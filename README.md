# Usage
1. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. For datasets with sentences or paragraphs per cell, use `schedulesngrams.py`. For datasets where it's just one word per cell, use `schedulesfavorites.py`
3. Make sure your CSV file's column name starts with 'tweet' if using `schedulesngrams.py` (or 'user' if using `schedulesfavorites.py`) and that there's a column called 'date' with the date formatted as follows: `2012-03-24`
4. Make sure the columns are sorted by descending order (latest dates first).

# Example
Originally, I made this for twitter data, but of course it also works for blogs. For example, here's my analysis of systems scientist George Mobus' blog.

Plateuing lines means "interest" is decaying.
